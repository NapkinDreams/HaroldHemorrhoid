If2. Kb1 Ra8! 3. Qa3 Qd4!. This is the point — the variation shows the
strength of the queen-and-bishop battery when it is aimed at the main
target, the king. Now after 4. Qc3 Qxc3 5. bxc3 Bxc3, Black wins the
rook.
&&
White cannot capture the pawn on d4 because of 21. ... Ba4, followed by
... c5.
&&
danger! The best defense is 23…a5 24 a3
(Black should hold after 24 xd7 xd7 25 bxa5 bxa5 26 c5 dxc5 27 xc5 a4)24…f5
and it’s hard for White to make progress. Black should never allow c5 without 
first forcing White to make the concession of exchanging the Bishop for the Knight.
&&
White tries to deflect Black from his plans, because otherwise he can’t
stop the invasion of Black’s rook into his camp. After 46. Ra3 Qb2, Black
wins.
&&
Can Black activate his light-squared bishop? Not by 11. ... c5?, as 12. b4
cxb4 13. axb4 Qxb4 14. c5 traps Black’s queen.
&&
Black’s best defense here was 28. ... c5. Still, after 29. Rxc5 Rxc5 30.
Rxc5 Qxa4 31. Qxa4 Bxa4 32. Ra5 and 33. Ra5xa7, Black is more likely
to lose than to draw. Not only is he a pawn down, but most important, with
rooks on the board, Black’s king remains very vulnerable.
&&
This move loses immediately, but even the stronger 35. ... Kg7 does not
save Black. For example: 36. Rxd1 Rxd1 37. Rd4 Qf1 38. Rxd1 Qxd1 39.
Qg5 Qd7 40. Qf6+ Kg8 41. Be3 Kh7 42. h4, with the threat of Bh6.
&&
White seeks to exchange his two weak pawns for the strong pawn on c5.
&&
White gives up a pawn in order to activate the knight. Black, however, is
not required to rush to capture it.
