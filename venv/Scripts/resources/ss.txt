Squat depth is a function of hip angle, the angle formed between the generalized plane of the torso and the
femur. If you try to drop down to get better depth without adjusting the position of your femurs, you’ll get depth at
the expense of a rounded lower back because the hip angle cannot become more closed if the femurs are
impinged. The pelvis is supposed to be locked in line with the lumbar vertebrae and held rigid by the erector
spinae muscles. If the pelvis can’t tilt forward to maintain this position because it rams into an obstruction, the only
spinae muscles. If the pelvis can’t tilt forward to maintain this position because it rams into an obstruction, the only
way to keep going deeper is to round the low back. Everybody, big belly or not, will experience this phenomenon
to one degree or another, so if you’re having depth problems, shoving the knees out fixes these problems so often
that it is a waste of time to do anything else first.
Most people won’t do the job of keeping their knees out unless they’re coached; the knees want to track more
medially because of the tension felt on the inside of the femurs. This tension is produced by the adductors – the
groin muscles. These five muscles (the adductor magnus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, pectineus, and
gracilis) attach at various points along the medial and posterior aspects of the femur, and on the ischium and
pubis of the pelvis. Tension is produced between these two bones as you squat down and keep your knees out; this
is an eccentric action for these muscles because they lengthen on the way down – if the femurs maintain their
position parallel to the feet. As you come up out of the squat and the hip angle opens up, the distance between the
inside of the femur and the medial pelvis shortens, so the concentric action of the adductor muscles thus produces
hip extension. (See Figure 2-44).
Visualize the function of the adductors by imagining a point at the end of the inside of your thigh down by
your knee, and another point on your “seat bone,” under your butt and behind your crotch. These points represent
the attachments of the adductor magnus. Your spinal erector muscles lock your back in extension and lock your
pelvis in line with your back, so as you squat down and make your back more horizontal, your seat bones rotate
back and away from your knees. If your knees stay in position, pointed in the same direction as your feet – out at
about 30 degrees – the distance between the point on the inside of your thigh and your seat bone increases. And
if this distance increases as you go down and decreases as you come up, the muscles that get longer on the way
down make the “up” part happen as they get shorter. This is how the adductor muscles function in a correctly
performed squat and why they are considered hip extensors, along with the glutes and hamstrings, as part of the
posterior chain.
Since the adductors tend to pull the knees in, what keeps them out when you use your hips correctly? If ad -
duction of the thighs means pulling the distal end of the femurs (the knees) toward the midline of the body, it
seems like ab -duction would be the movement used to keep the knees out, and that the abductors would be the
muscles that did this. But the abductors consist of only the tensor fascia latae (TFL, a small muscle that connects
the hip at the anterior iliac crest to the lower leg), the gluteus medius, and the gluteus minimus. Together they
create hip abduction if you raise your leg out to the side, away from your body. Since nobody actually does this,
except to demonstrate the definition of abduction in biomechanics class, this is probably not what is going on when
we squat.
External rotation occurs when you make your right femur rotate clockwise and your left femur rotate
counterclockwise, as when you stand up and pivot on your heels to rotate your toes away from each other. There
are at least nine muscles that perform this function: the gluteus medius, minimus, and maximus, the adductor
minimus, the quadratus femoris, the inferior gemellus, the obturator internus, the superior gemellus, and the
piriformis. (Notice that the external rotators include two of the abductor muscles.) External rotation is critical to
stabilizing gait mechanics through the stride. As it relates to our analysis, the action of rotating the femurs out is
what actually occurs when you shove your knees out on the way down to the bottom of the squat. Prove this to
yourself by sitting in a chair and rotating your femurs the same way you would if you were standing up and
pivoting on your heels to point your toes out. Using the external rotators to set the knees in a position parallel to
the feet makes all kinds of sense when you consider that they are in an effective position to do it and the TFL is not.
So shoving the knees out at the top of the squat, and keeping them there so that the adductors can do their job, is
accomplished by the muscles that rotate the hips externally. These muscles anchor the thigh position that allows
for both good squat depth and the more effective use of all the muscles of the hips.



When you’re learning how to bench, it might be prudent to use a spotter if one is available. Spotting the
bench press will be dealt with in detail later, but for our purposes in this early phase of learning, a spotter is
there to keep the unracking and racking of the bar safe for the lifter. The leverage disadvantage of having the bar
several inches behind the shoulders is not a problem at lighter weights, but as the load increases, it becomes one
rather quickly. With the right equipment, i.e., you are working inside a correctly set-up power rack, a spotter is not
absolutely necessary. Even on an open bench, you are using very light weights during the learning phase, and you
should not have enough weight on the bar to give a spotter anything to do. A bad spotter who will not stay out of
your way while you train is actually a detriment and can quite often cause more problems for you than he can
prevent. If you are just learning to bench and you’re worried about your ability to handle the bar, you have too
much weight on it. If a 45-pound bar is too heavy – as it might be in your particular circumstances – use a lighter
bar. If you are concerned, use a spotter, but make sure to use an experienced, competent, patient individual who
will not insist on “helping” you just for the sake of participating in your exercise program. If you are forced to use
an inexperienced spotter, explain as thoroughly as possible the specifics of the job, described in detail at the end
of this chapter.
As usual, start with an empty bar. ALWAYS start every lift with an empty bar, whether learning the lift for the
first time or warming up for a personal record. Lie down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this
position, you should be far enough down (“down” always meaning toward the foot end of the bench) from the bar
that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the down side of the bar (Figure 5-4). This means just a short
distance, not several inches, which would increase the difficulty of getting the bar unracked.
Figure 5-4. Eye position for the setup. The eyes look just past the bar, placing the body the correct distance down the bench.

After getting into position, take an overhand grip on the bar. Your grip should be somewhere between 22
and 24 inches, measured between the index fingers; the variation is based on differences in shoulder width. This
grip width will produce a vertical forearm for most people when the bar is on the chest, a position that produces
the most range of motion around the shoulder joint during the movement. The bar should rest on the heel of your
palm (not up near the fingers), and directly over the bones of the forearm, so that power being transmitted up the
arms and to the bar goes directly to the bar without being channeled through the wrists. Wrap your fingers
around the bar AFTER you have set it correctly on the heels of your hands. This grip is best accomplished by
pronating your hands, with a slight internal rotation of your arms.
Figure 5-6 . Grip width for the bench press.
You are now ready to take the bar out of the rack. Look directly up at the ceiling, above your position on the
bench, and push up on the bar, locking out your elbows. With elbows locked, move the bar out to a position
directly over the line of your shoulder joints – the glenohumeral joints – to place your arms in a perfectly vertical
position relative to the joints and thus to the floor. Don’t stop before you get the bar over your chest, because if
you do, the bar will be over your chin or throat. Make sure the bar gets out to the place it needs to be, right over
the joint. This is the place where the bar is in balance at lockout, where there is no moment arm between the bar
and the fulcrum that is the shoulder joint. Move the bar to this position quickly and without hesitation, with your
elbows locked out the entire time. Your spotter can help you do this the first few times, just making sure the bar
clears your face and neck and gets all the way out over your chest.
As the bar becomes stable in the lockout position, look at the very important picture directly overhead. You
will be staring at the ceiling directly above the bar, and the ceiling with the bar in the foreground will comprise
your entire field of vision. This picture is your reference for the path the bar will take as you move it down and up.
You will see the bar against the ceiling in the lower half of your field of vision. Look at the bar’s position relative to
the features you see on the surface of the ceiling. Don’t look at the bar; look at the ceiling and just see the bar.
Move the bar a tiny bit. Notice that if the bar moves even a little, you can tell by the change it makes against the
ceiling. The bar moves and the ceiling does not, and the ceiling is therefore your position reference for the bar.
Note carefully the position of the bar against the ceiling. You will lower the bar to your chest, touch the
chest, and then drive the bar right back to exactly the same position. Stare at the place on the ceiling where the
bar is to go. DO NOT look at the bar as it moves; do NOT follow the bar with your eyes, but just stare at the ceiling.
You are going to make the bar go to that place every rep.
With the bar locked out over the shoulders, have your spotter touch your chest a few inches below (inferior
to) the bar’s vertical position, at about the middle of your sternum. Have him push hard enough that you can feel it
after he takes the finger away. This tactile cue will quite effectively identify the point on your chest to touch the bar.
If there is no spotter and you are benching alone inside a rack, unlock your elbows straight out to the sides and
then allow them to drop towards your feet a little on the way down. Just a little. If you do this correctly, the net
effect will be the same as the spotter’s touch – the bar will contact your sternum a few inches below your clavicles,
and therefore below your shoulder joints. Note that the precise position the bar should contact the sternum will
vary with the chest up position of the lifter on the bench, but the middle of the sternum, a few inches below the
clavicles, is a good place to start. The goal here is to produce a bar path that is not vertical, for reasons which will
be discussed in detail later.
With this in mind, look at the ceiling, unlock your elbows, lower the bar to the chest, touch it without
stopping, and drive the bar back at the point on the ceiling your eyes have trapped. Try it for a set of five reps.
You’ll notice immediately that if your eyes don’t move from their fixed position, the bar will go to the same place
every rep.
This little eyeball trick works 90% of the time the first time it is used to produce a correct bench-press bar
path. Even if you are “poorly coordinated,” you should be able to do a fairly good bench press within a couple of
sets by using this technique. “The groove,” as the bar path is often referred to by bench pressers, is the first and
most frustrating problem that novice trainees will experience because the tendency is to follow the bar with your
eyes. By focusing your eyes on the ceiling, you can eliminate this problem the vast majority of the time. If the bar
finds the groove automatically, as it does with this method, you can direct your attention to other aspects of the
exercise that might be a problem.
The key to the whole method is staring at the fixed position and not at the moving bar. If you use a fixed
reference point for the bar position, you can make the bar go to the same place – and therefore through the same
path – each rep. If you follow the bar with your eyes, you have no way to direct the bar to the same place every
time because you are looking at the thing you are moving and not at the place you want it to go. This is the same
principle used to hit a golf ball or a tennis ball: the implement moves to the target (the ball), and the target is the
object of the fixed eye gaze. Granted, tennis balls move and golf balls don’t (until they’re hit), but the principle is
the same. The brain coordinates the hands to take the implement – the club, racquet, pool cue, or bat, or the
sword, sledgehammer, axe, or barbell – to the target, because the target is the reference for the eyes. When a
tennis ball moves, the head and eyes move with it, rendering it a stationary point. Fortunately, most ceilings don’t
move in most weight rooms, so our task is easier than McEnroe’s, but it is similar in that we are driving an object
in our hands toward a stationary thing we are actively looking at. There are similarities between seemingly
diverse activities, all of which involve movement directed by the eyes. Whether the object of the movement is
stationary or in motion, the implement in the hands goes where the eye gaze is focused.
Do another set of five with the bar, reinforcing your eye position, and then rack the bar. This is done with
locked elbows, after the last rep is finished, by moving the bar back to the uprights, touching them with the bar,
and then setting it down in the hooks. Should you have a spotter, this movement back to the rack should be
covered. For the next sets of five reps, add weight a little at a time – 10 pounds at a time for smaller kids and
women, 20 or even 30 pounds for bigger trainees – until the bar speed begins to slow down and your form starts
to change. Stay there for two more sets of five, and that is the first workout.



The press starts at the rack with the empty bar. It should be set at the same height as for the squat, at about
the middle of the sternum. If you are a female, a younger trainee, or an older or injured person, be aware that a
45-pound bar may be too heavy to start with on this exercise. Take steps to ensure that the proper equipment is
available, or you will never have a chance to learn the exercise properly.
The grip for the press is determined by the simple mechanics we already know. The width is such that it
places the forearms in a vertical position as seen from the back or front (Figure 3-8). This grip places your index
fingers somewhere between the edge of the knurl and a half-inch out from the knurl.
Figure 3-8. Grip width, just outside the shoulders, to produce vertical forearms.
T here are exc eptionally large people who need a wider grip to keep the forearm s vertic al, but not m any. Too wide
a grip c reates m om ent arm s between the grip pos ition on the bar and the elbows , between the elbows and the
s houlders , and between the grip and the s houlders ; and thes e m om ent arm s are leverage you will have to
overc om e that need not be there at all (Figure 3-9). T he c hoic e of equipm ent m ay not be up to you here, and m os t

are c los e to this ). It m ight m ake things eas ier if you m ark your oddball bar to this s tandard s o that you c an us e
the s am e grip width every tim e.
The grip should position the bones of the forearm directly under the bar, to eliminate any leverage
produced against the wrist from having the bar too far back in the hand. The best way to position the grip
efficiently is to set the grip width at your index fingers, and then rotate your hands into pronation by pointing your
thumbs down toward your feet. This setup aligns the bar with the radial longitudinal crease and between the
thenar eminence (the high spot adjacent to the thumb) and the medial palmar (hypothenar ) eminence on the
other side – parallel to your “life-line,” to use a more familiar term. Then, just lay your fingers down on the bar
and squeeze the fingertips into the bar. When you take it out of the rack, the bar will be on the heel of your palm
and directly over your forearm bones, as shown in Figure 3-10. The thumbless grip is never used when pressing,
not because of the danger – which is obviously not there when the bar can be dropped to the floor. Rather, the
thumbs-around grip permits the “squeeze” in the forearms that increases the tightness of the muscles, making the
drive from the start position more efficient and increasing motor unit recruitment throughout the arms and upper
body. Except for the squat, there is no thumbless grip in barbell training.

Take the bar out of the rack – the EMPTY BAR, at the correct weight for your ability. Your grip will have
placed the bar on the heel of your palms, and your elbows should now move to a position just in front of the bar
when viewed from the side. This placement creates a vertical position for the radius bone of the forearm. (Most
people place the elbows under or behind the bar, positions that tend to make the bar drive away from the body
when you press.) Shrug your shoulders up and forward just a little; the idea is to have the bar resting on top of
your anterior deltoids, the meaty part of your shoulders, at the start of the movement.
Inflexible people may not be able to get the shoulders far enough forward and up to put the bar in this
position at first; if flexibility is the problem, you will quickly stretch out. Some people have long forearms relative
to the length of their upper arms, and this anthropometry makes getting the bar on the deltoids impossible with
the elbows in the correct position and a narrow grip. Sitting on the delts is the ideal position for the bar, but the
movement can be done from a less-than-perfect position without any real problem. Very flexible people should
make sure not to raise the elbows too high; doing so pulls the scapulae forward and produces a lack of tightness
and stability across the shoulder blades that is not conducive to an efficient press.
Your stance in the press is not as precisely critical as it is in the squat. Take a comfortable stance, and you
will usually end up with something that will work. Your squat stance actually works well for the press. Too close a
stance creates a balance problem, and much farther apart than the squat stance feels pretty weird. We will not be
using a ground reaction in this lift (since it is not a push press), so don’t worry about trying to simulate a vertical
jump stance for this lift. In fact, when in doubt, go a little wider.
Many initial position problems can be prevented with a correct positioning of the eyes. Look straight ahead
to a point on the wall that is level with your eyes. (This assumes that you are in a facility with walls. If the walls are
too far away, a piece of equipment will do.) Stare at that point for the whole set. You might need to give yourself a
point to look at. If you need to, draw a big dot on a sheet of paper and hang it up at the point that causes your
eyes to hold the correct position.
Now lift your chest. This is actually accomplished by placing the upper part of the erector spinae in
contraction. Think about lifting your sternum up to your chin or showing off your boobs. (Sorry for the coarse
analogy, but you’ll have to admit that it’s useful.) Refer to Figure 3-13 for this position. “Chest up” is really a back
contraction, and the press and the front squat are the two best exercises for strengthening and developing control
of these muscles. Lifting your chest produces tightness in the upper back and in the entire kinetic chain, making
your connection to the ground more stable and improving your pressing mechanics overall.
Figure 3-13. (A) The correct upper back position, providing a firm platform from which to drive the bar. (B) A relaxed upper back.
When your elbows are up correctly and you have lifted your chest, you are ready to press the bar. The press
is learned in two stages: First, you will put the bar where it is going to be in the finished position. This step
consists of learning the lockout position and the anatomical and mechanical reasons for using it. Second, you will
learn how to get the bar there correctly. This step consists of learning how to produce a mechanically efficient bar
path and how to use your whole body to do it.
Step 1: Take a big breath, hold it (our friend the Valsalva maneuver), and drive the bar up over your head.
The vast majority of people will press the bar up to lockout but in a position just in front of the forehead. Make
sure that you have the bar directly above the back of your neck, a point that should have the bar, the
glenohumeral joint, and the mid-foot in a straight vertical line (Figure 3-14). This is the position in which there is
minimal leverage operating against the primary segments of the kinetic chain – the bar to the shoulder, and the
shoulder down to the mid-foot. If the bar is directly plumb to the shoulder joints, the load applies no leverage to
the shoulders. If the shoulders are plumb to the mid-foot, the back and legs apply no leverage to the balance
point. If the bar is plumb to the mid-foot, the entire kinetic chain is in simple compression, with no leverage
against the primary segments.
Once the bar is over your head correctly, lock your elbows and shrug up your shoulders to support the bar.
The bones of the arm are lined up in a column by the triceps and deltoids; the shoulders are shrugged up with the
trapezius; and the arms and the traps must work together to support heavy weights overhead. Imagine someone
behind you gently pushing your elbows together and pulling them up at the same time, as illustrated in Figure 3-
15. The combination of locking the elbows out and shrugging the traps up at lockout, with the bar directly over the
ears, produces a very firm, stable position at the top that involves all of the shoulder-girdle muscles and prevents
shoulder impingement.
It is helpful to think about the lockout as a continuation of the upward drive, as though you are never
finished pressing the bar upward. When the load is heavy, this cue provides the last little push necessary to get the
bar into the lockout position. Think about pressing the bar up to the ceiling.
Step 2: After this lockout position is correct, it is time to learn how to best drive the bar to this position. This
step involves making the bar path correct and establishing the proper movement of your body in relation to the
bar. Since the bar is sitting on your deltoids, in front of the neck, and it must move up to a position above the
shoulder joints, several inches behind the starting position, there must be a relative lateral movement of several
inches on the way up (Figure 3-16). But barbells like to travel in straight vertical lines up and down, especially
when they’re heavy. Our vertical bar path must therefore be produced in a way that takes the load from a position
in front of the shoulders to the lockout position plumb to the shoulder joints. We do this with motion of the torso.
Lean back slightly by pushing your hips forward. This slight movement must not be produced by bending the
knees or the lumbar spine. Rather, the movement is a function of only the hips. Without the bar and with your
hands on your hips, push your pelvis forward and back a few times, keeping your knees and your low back locked
in position. Try to do this rocking motion with just your hip joints. When the weight gets heavy, your abs will lock
your low back and your quads will lock your knees, involving both of these muscle masses in the exercise
isometrically. It’s easy unweighted, but later it becomes a huge part of this challenging exercise (Figure 3-17).
When you understand this motion, take the bar out of the rack, making sure that your grip and elbow
position are correct, and then push your hips forward and drive the bar up straight. As soon as it crosses the top of
your forehead, get under the bar . Move your body forward under the bar and drive it to lockout. Don’t move the
bar back – slam yourself forward under the bar (Figure 3-18). When you do this correctly, you will find that the
forward torso movement contributes to lockout at the top: as the shoulder drives forward, the contracting deltoid
and tricep bring the upper arm and the forearm into alignment, thus driving up the bar.

Figure 3-18. The torso drives forward as the bar drives up.
Do this for a set of five, and rack the bar. Do as many sets as necessary with the empty bar to clarify the
concept of moving yourself forward under the bar, as opposed to moving the bar back to the shoulder joint. Make
sure you’re leaning back before you start to press, because it’s very common to start the press with a vertical torso
and then lean back as the bar starts up. Hips-forward must occur before the press starts, or the bar will travel
forward around your chin, not up in an efficient vertical path.

To further reinforce the vertical bar path, think about keeping the bar close to your face on the way up. Aim
for your nose as the bar leaves your shoulders. Then, as you lower the bar for the next rep, aim for your nose on
the way down as well. You may actually hit yourself in the nose before you figure this out, but you’ll probably do it
just once. By establishing a bar path close to your face on both the concentric and eccentric halves of the
movement, you practice it starting from the very first sets of the exercise.
After as much practice with the empty bar as is necessary, start up in 5-, 10-, or 20-pound jumps, whatever
is appropriate for your age and strength, until the bar speed begins to slow markedly on the fifth rep of the set,
and call it a workout.
Faults and Corrections
There won’t be nearly as many problems with the press as there are with the squat or deadlift, because
there are fewer joints actively participating in the movement of the bar. Most problems are either starting position
problems or bar path problems, and they result in a missed press for really just two reasons:
Y ou fail to get the bar off your c hes t.
T he dis tanc e between the s houlder and the bar bec om es too long a m om ent arm to overc om e: bar
path problem s .
The first problem happens because you have lost your tightness in the start position due to breathing
errors, positioning errors (chest not up, elbows not up, etc.), or a focus error or because you have just gotten
tired or the weight is too heavy. The second problem occurs because you have produced an incorrect bar path .
You pushed the bar forward instead of up, you failed to hold your position under the bar as you pushed it up, or
you failed to get back under the bar after it crossed your forehead. Let’s look at the conditions under which these
errors occur and figure out how to prevent them.
Losing tightness
There are two types of upper back looseness that commonly screw up the press. The first type, caused by
letting the chest cave in so that the upper back rounds, is very common. Heavy weight on a press is uncomfortable
enough already, without your exacerbating the problem with a lack of good support. Keeping the chest up holds
the thoracic spine in proper anatomical position, and this is primarily accomplished with the upper back muscles
and your breathing pattern. When the upper erector spinae muscles contract, they rotate the rib cage up, holding
it in place against the load on the shoulders. Remembering to “lift the chest” is usually all that is required, but
most people will need to really focus on this in every rep for a while. The attention span can be short under a bar,
especially a heavy bar on the front of the shoulders, and focusing on technique gets more difficult as the weight
gets heavier. A big held breath – the same Valsalva maneuver that is used for all barbell exercises – is your friend
during the press. Air is support, in this case for the rib cage as well as for the spine, and the act of tightening and
lifting the chest is so enmeshed in the action of taking a big breath under a heavy load that the two are essentially
inseparable. They happen at the same time and they signal each other to happen.
Figure 3-20. Lifting the chest is primarily a function of the upper back muscles.
You will have to take a new breath before each rep, at least for a while, or you risk a “blackout” at heavier
we i g h ts. Vasovagal syncope is the term applied to a blackout or fainting. It can be caused by a
sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system response to 1) pressure on the neck from the bar, 2) the shrugged
lockout position, and/or 3) the general effects of the anterior bar position’s load on the vascular structure in the
neck that is known as the carotid sinus. Pressure applied to the carotid sinus by any of these three mechanisms can
produce a blackout in susceptible people by reducing the heart rate at exactly the wrong time (interestingly
enough, this seldom happens in women). The phenomenon is not directly related to the Valsalva itself because a
loaded Valsalva is not a problem for healthy people in the squat, bench press, or deadlift, in which the loaded
Valsalva results in increased blood flow to the brain. The chances of a blackout happening increases markedly if
you do not release the pressure between each rep by taking a new breath.
Blackouts under the bar can be a problem because if you fall, your weight room surroundings are never a
comfortable place to land in a big heap with a loaded barbell. The press and the rack position of the clean are the
only two places that blacking out is usually a problem, so be prepared if it happens. You will feel a change in
perception before the event occurs. If possible, rack or drop the bar. If the feeling persists or gets worse (your
knees will begin to wobble), take a knee so you’ll have a shorter distance to fall. The blackout itself is harmless
and will pass in a few seconds with no lasting effects; the fall is the problem, so be careful.
The other way to be loose is to let the elbows and the shoulders slide down, or to never get them up in the
correct position. When you fail to hold the elbows up, the shoulders drop, too. This combination not only places
the elbows in a bad mechanical position to press, but also lets the bar drop down the chest a little, thereby adding
to the distance the bar must be pressed. A longer bar path means more work done on the weight from a worse
position, thus decreasing the weight you can lift that way. Keep your shoulders up and your elbows just in front of
the bar so that the bar path is shorter and more efficient and the bottom position is better supported between
reps.
Using an inefficient bar path
The second major problem is an inefficient bar path. Barbells like to move in straight vertical lines, and
your job is to arrange your body movements so that the bar can do this. You have to lean back before the press
starts, and 95% of people will not lean back enough to enable the bar to clear the chin without introducing
forward movement into the bar path. Leaning back enables you to perform the press efficiently. Make up your
mind that you are going to lean back before you start every rep of the press.
The heavier the weight, the greater the tendency for the bar path to head away from the shoulder joints.
When the distance between the shoulder joints and the bar gets to the point where the leverage created by this
moment arm exceeds your strength – even if the load itself does not – you will get stuck on the way up. It is critical
to keep the bar close. Three common bar path problems cause this to happen; pushing the bar away, failing to get
under the bar after it passes the forehead, and leaning back away from the bar are all different problems, but
they all affect the press the same way.

First, the most common form problem with light weights is having the bar out in front too far, away from the
face; this problem is produced by a bar path that curves away from the face (Figure 3-22). Heavy weights like to
move in straight vertical lines because they represent less energy expenditure than do longer, curved bar paths.
This is true for all barbell exercises, from the simple press to the more complex snatch and clean and jerk. Heavy
weights must follow a straight vertical bar path in the press because heavy weights can’t be pressed in a curve.
And if the bar moves forward, your back must go backward so that the system’s center of mass stays balanced over
the mid-foot. This loss of control erodes the position necessary for a powerful press, with the delts and triceps
driving up on the elbows held close to the body, in a position of increased mechanical efficiency with a shorter
lever arm. Sometimes allowing the elbows to drop into a lower position is what makes the forearms less than
vertical. This is an easy thing to correct if you catch it early: raise your elbows until they are just in front of the bar,
and aim the bar at your nose. After you lock the bar out at the top, aim for your nose on the way down so you can
practice keeping the bar close 10 times per set of 5 reps.
Second, leaving the bar out in front – not “getting under the bar” – is a different problem, and it most
definitely will occur with heavy weights. When the bar has been started perfectly straight up but the lifter fails to
move forward under the bar after it clears the head, the same position problem occurs at a higher point in the
bar path. You have to get in the habit of slamming your body forward under the press just as soon as the bar
passes your forehead. This pattern must be embedded early in the process of learning the exercise, and it must
be consciously revisited each workout, from the empty bar on up.
There is another way to make the body get forward under the bar at lockout. As is so often the case in
athletics, a thing can be conceived of and understood in many different ways. The lockout of the press can be
thought of as the shoulders moving forward under the bar, but it can also be approached from the opposite
dir ection, as the hips moving back as the bar crosses the forehead. These are obviously two different ways to
explain the same concept. If the lift starts with a slight hip extension, lockout is facilitated when the hips are
straightened fast and the shoulders and elbows are driven up, as previously illustrated. Both the chest and
shoulders moving forward or the hips moving back produce the same net effect relative to the bar; use the cue
that helps you best. As you become experienced as a lifter, you should get better at understanding the mechanics
of what is happening under the bar and be able to visualize more solutions for movement problems you may be
experiencing.
An emphasis on getting forward under the bar can result in a balance problem, noticeable as a tendency to
be on the ball of the foot during the drive and lockout. A good connection with the ground requires that the weight
be evenly distributed over the whole foot even as the bar is centered over the middle of it. Any shifting forward
during the press must be done in the context of the entire body staying in balance under the bar. If the forward
shift is sufficient to actually alter the center of gravity of the lifter/barbell system, you will have to compensate by
moving a foot or both feet forward to avoid losing balance. Getting under the bar comes from a shift in torso
position, not from a shift affecting the body all the way to the ground. Excessive movement disrupts the kinetic
chain and the lift. For some people, the initial forward hips position can be cued by thinking about shifting the
weight to the toes and squeezing the glutes, but as soon as the drive upward starts the system must return to
balance over the mid-foot. Thinking about the mid-foot and its relationship to the bar as a vertical slot in which to
drive the bar upward is the best cue for correcting a balance problem.
The third bar path problem is the tendency to push yourself away from the bar. Leaning back during the
drive off the shoulders is a problem that gets worse as the weight gets heavier. Hips are a vital part of the press,
with a little hip extension established to “cock” the drive off the shoulders. Timing gets off, and you drive the bar
up and then lean back from the hips, instead of leaning back first and then driving the bar up. The distance
between the bar and the shoulders increases, not much at first but enough to kill the press when the weight gets
heavy. The bar path itself may start out vertical, but as the leverage decays, the bar will drift forward.


The Deadlift
The bar should be loaded to a light weight relative to your capability. A light weight for a novice 55-yearold
woman will be different from that for an 18-year-old 205-pound athlete. Your gym should be equipped to
load weights as light as 55 pounds, or possibly even lighter, to accommodate people of all levels of ability. This
makes it necessary to obtain 5–10 lb plastic training plates that space a “45” lb (20 kg), 15 kg, or even 10 kg bar
off the floor to the same height as a standard plate: 17¾ inches, or 45 cm. If you cannot get these light plates, you
can place blocks under 10 or 25 lb iron plates, or set the bar at the correct height in the power rack; the small
iron plates place the bar closer to the floor than most people’s flexibility can accommodate in a correct starting
position. Judgment must be exercised here; the starting weight must be light enough so that if your form is bad,
you cannot hurt yourself, just in case these instructions are not followed closely enough. So 55 pounds or lighter
will be the starting weight for some people, 40 kilos (88 pounds) will work for most women and lighterbodyweight
novices, and 135 pounds will work for athletes and more experienced trainees. There is never a
reason for anyone other than a competitive lifter to start heavier than 135 pounds.
Figure 4-8. The standard plate diameter provides a standard height for the bar above the floor. Different weights in this standard diameter allow
people of different strength levels to pull from this standard height, 8? inches or 20.5 cm between the bottom of the bar and the floor.
This method for learning the deadlift proceeds in five steps. Pay careful attention to each step as you are
learning. As the steps become more practiced and familiar, they will merge into a continuous pattern of
movements.
Step 1: Stance
The stance for the deadlift is about the same as the stance for a flat-footed vertical jump, about 8–12 inches
between the heels, depending on anthropometry, with the toes pointed out. Bigger, taller people with wider hips
will use a proportionately wider stance. This stance is much narrower than the squat’s stance because of the
difference between the two movements: the squat is done from the top down, with the hips lowered and driven up;
the deadlift starts at the bottom, with the feet pushing the floor, the back locked in place, and the legs driving the
floor away from the bar. The difference in stance is due to this difference in hip and knee mechanics and the need
to accommodate a narrow grip for pulling efficiency (Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-9. The starting stance for the deadlift places the heels approximately 8–12 inches apart, with the toes pointed slightly out.
The bar should be 1–1½ inches from your shins. For almost every human being on the planet, this distance
places the bar directly over the middle of the foot, the position over which the bar stays on its way up to lockout.
Most people are reluctant to keep the bar close enough to their legs during the pull, as well as when setting it
down, and for that matter before the bar leaves the ground. This reluctance is often due to the fear of marring the
beauty of the shins and thighs and a lack of appreciation of the significance of balance in the pull. Efficient bar
paths are straight vertical lines, and if the bar starts from a position directly over the mid-foot and travels
vertically to lockout directly over the mid-foot, the most efficient pull will have occurred. It is common to mistake
the middle of the forefoot – between the tibia and the end of the toes – for the middle of the whole foot, the place
the bar should actually be. The bar should be positioned with half the foot forward of the bar and half the foot
behind it, so that the bar is directly over the middle of the arch of the foot, the point directly under which the
weight of the lifter/barbell system is centered across the sole of the foot against the ground.
When you have the bar in this position, point your toes out. The angle will be at least 10 degrees and
maybe as much as 30 degrees (see the picture of George Hechter in Figure 4-39). Your toes might be more
pointed out than you want them to be. This stance places the hips in external rotation just as it did for the squat,
providing the same benefits: more adductor and external rotator involvement in the movement, as well as
clearance between the femurs for the torso so that a good start position can be obtained.
Step 2: Grip
After you have assumed the correct stance, grip the bar, double-overhand and thumbs around, at a width
that places your hands in a position in which your hands are close to your legs, without being so close that you rub
your thumbs against them as you pull. This grip results in the shortest distance to lockout for the barbell (as
should be obvious from our discussion of the snatch grip earlier). Bar markings are the knurling on a standard
Olympic bar, which will always have a smooth space in the middle (and which may have a 6-inch center knurl in
the middle of this space). Standard bar markings are at about 16½ inches for this middle space, so the grip can
be set according to this dimension. Most people’s hands will be about an inch into the knurl, or about 18½ inches
between hands. Bigger people will need to use a proportionately wider grip to match their stance, while most
women will need to put their hands closer together than this, with their index fingers on the edge of the knurl. Be
aware that most people tend to take too wide a grip. If your grip is 3 inches into the knurl and your hands are
touching your legs, your stance is too wide unless you are very broad through the hips.
Take your grip on the bar by bending over at the waist, stiff-legged, without lowering the hips. Most
important at this point and for the following steps is that you DO NOT MOVE THE BAR. You have gone to
considerable trouble to place the bar directly above the mid-foot for pulling efficiency, and if you move it during
this or any subsequent steps, you will have undone Step 1.
Step 3: Knees forward
With your grip secure, bend your knees and drop them forward just to the point where the shins touch the
bar. Again, DO NOT MOVE THE BAR, since it is already where you want it over your foot. Hips do not drop down
during this movement – only the knees and shins move . Once the shins are touching the bar, the hips freeze in
position. They do not drop any farther. Now shove your knees out just a little to establish the slight angle of the
thighs and knees that keeps them parallel to your feet. Knees will be in contact with elbows after this happens, and
that is fine. The correct grip width will have the clearances very close during the pull, and if the grip is correct and
the thighs are externally rotated a little, the knees will touch the elbows. Most people will try to lower their hips
during this step. If you do this, you will push your knees forward, thus pushing the bar forward. Just touch the bar
with the shins and shove your knees out just a little.
Step 4: Chest up
This will be the most difficult step for most people: squeeze your chest up into the deadlift start position.
Lifting the chest is accomplished by using the muscles of the upper back, and this starts a process of spinal
extension that finishes at the pelvis. While gripping the bar, being careful NOT TO MOVE IT, shove your rib cage
up so that your chest rotates up between your arms. Let this contraction continue down your back until your lumbar
spine is tightened into contraction as well. In this way, your back is properly positioned for you to pull without
dropping your hips – the back will have positioned itself correctly so you can pull from the top down instead of by
lowering the hips, which would shove the bar forward. DO NOT try to squeeze your shoulder blades together in
the back; scapular adduction will pull you down closer to the bar into a position that you cannot maintain with a
heavy weight because that’s not where your shoulder blades actually stay during a pull. When you are in the
correct position, stare at a point 12–15 feet in front of you on the floor so that your neck can assume its normal
anatomical position. You might need to think about keeping your chin down, too.
This step will be difficult because of hamstring tension fighting against the proper extension of the lower
back. Remember: The back muscles and the hamstrings are in a war for control over your pelvic position, and the
lower back must win. During this step, most people will try to drop their hips. If you do this, the bar will roll
forward of the mid-foot. Your hips will probably be higher than you want them, especially if you have been
deadlifting using another method. Keep your hips up, and compensate for this weird feeling by squeezing the
chest up even more. After you do a few deadlifts and your hamstrings get warm, the movement will feel better and
more familiar.
Step 5: Pull
Take a big breath and drag the bar up your legs. This means exactly what it says: “drag” implies contact,
and the bar never leaves contact with your legs on the way up to lockout. This step will be the first time that the
bar actually moves at all, and if you do it correctly, the bar path will be a straight vertical line, starting at its
position directly over the mid-foot and ending at the top at arms’ length with your chest up, knees and hips in
extension, spine in the normal anatomical position, and feet flat on the floor. If at any time during the pull the bar
leaves your legs – which often happens as the bar gets above the knees and near the thighs – it will be off
balance, forward of your mid-foot.
If the bar loses contact with your shins as you start the pull, it has traveled forward. Leaving the bar out
away from the legs may be due to the perfectly natural desire not to scrape the shins, but the bar must remain
close to the legs to avoid getting it out of balance. Make up your mind that you’re going to keep it close, and wear
sweats or thin shin guards to protect your shins if you have to. If the bar moves forward anyway and you’re sure
you are squeezing your chest up, chances are that you were not in balance over the mid-foot when you started the
pull. This problem is commonly encountered with people who are wearing weightlifting shoes with heels that are
too tall, or with people who have long legs and a short back. If this happens, you will need to insert another step,
Step 4.5: before you start the pull, get your weight back off of your toes. Don’t exaggerate this by trying to
get back on your heels; just rock back a little and get the weight off of your toes and back onto your mid-foot, and
get back on your heels; just rock back a little and get the weight off of your toes and back onto your mid-foot, and
then think about pushing the mid-foot straight down into the floor.
At the top of the pull, just lift your chest. That’s all; don’t shrug your shoulders either up or back, and don’t
lean back. Just raise the chest. Seen from the side, this position will be anatomically normal, with both lordotic
and kyphotic curves in unexaggerated positions, your eyes looking slightly down, your hips and knees fully
extended, and your shoulders back. This is the position your body must assume to safely bear weight, and the
correct back position during the pull provides a safe way to transfer the load from the ground to this upright
position. Refer to Figure 4-12, 5d, for this position.
Down should be the perfect opposite of up, the only difference being that the bar can go down faster than it
went up. It is just as easy to injure the back by setting the bar down incorrectly as it is by picking the bar up
incorrectly, and it is extremely common to set the bar down wrong, with a round back and the knees forward, even
if you have pulled it correctly off the floor. A non-vertical bar path makes no more sense on the way down than it
does on the way up. Be sure that you lower the bar by first unlocking your hips and knees, and then shoving your
hips backward and letting the bar slide down your thighs in a straight vertical line, with your lower back locked in
extension, in a movement that is the opposite of the upward bar path. As the bar passes your knees, bend them to
finish setting the bar down, never unlocking the back. If your knees go forward before the bar passes them on the
way down, the bar will obviously have to go forward to get around them, and this usually means that you will have
also released your tight back position.
Fix your eyes on the floor at a point that is 12–15 feet in front of you, to put your neck in the normal
anatomical position, and pull a set of five. Think very hard and pay close attention to your form, concentrating
especially on your back position and keeping the bar close to your legs. If you’re sure your form is good enough,
add weight for a few sets until it feels like the next increase might be a problem, and that’s the first deadlift
workout.

Back Position
Everything else can be wrong with the deadlift and nothing really bad will happen, but if your low back is
round under a big load, safety will be compromised. So now is the time to learn the most important part of the
deadlift: setting the back correctly. After you set the bar down, stand up without the bar and lift your chest. At the
same time, arch your lower back by thinking about sticking your butt out. Refer to Figure 4-13 and imagine a
coach touching you on the chest to cue your chest-up position, and touching you at the small of your back to cue
your lumbar arch. The touch on your lower back gives you a point to “curl” your low back around as you stick out
your butt, the net effect of which is to cause the erector spinae muscles to contract under your conscious direction.
The arched position in which the contracted spinal erector muscles place the lower back is referred to as
lumbar extension . You will probably not be able to maintain this degree of lumbar extension at the starting
position with the bar on the floor because hamstring tension will pull your pelvis and lumbar spine out of this
position to some extent, depending on your flexibility. A few people – usually women and underweight men – are
so flexible that they can produce lumbar overextension at the bottom (Figure 4-14). This is not desirable at all
because an over-arched lower back is just as bad – and perhaps much worse – a position for the lumbar discs and
their normal weight-bearing ability as a rounded one. A loaded, overextended lumbar spine can not only harm
the intervertebral discs but also damage the facet joints and the close-by nerve roots. The desirable position is an
anatomically normal lordotic curve or normal anatomical arch. But to achieve this, most people will need to
concentrate on an exaggerated extension, because even the correct arch will test the limits of most people’s
flexibility. The point here is to learn to set your back and identify and control the muscles you must use to do this,
so that you can quickly develop the correct position. Once again, just to be sure you understand: an overextended
lumbar arch is NOT the position to use to start the deadlift. Normal anatomical position is. But it may be
necessary to try for overextension in order to produce normal anatomical position.
The majority of the problems encountered in the deadlift will involve an incorrect lower back position. Most
novice trainees who exhibit the most common incorrect back position in the deadlift – a round lower back – are
completely unaware of their back position. They are unable to identify the correct position, the incorrect position,
or any position in between. This may be your problem if you struggle for more than a couple of workouts with your
deadlift form. You may lack the kinesthetic sense – the ability to identify the spatial position of your body or a body
part – required to perform the movement correctly. The cause of this may be related to visual perception: you
can’t see your lower back, and you haven’t even attempted to look at it. You can tell if your elbows are flexed or
extended, but you have no idea if your low back is flexed or extended, probably because you haven’t thought about
it before, because you can’t see the muscles involved. Arms are in view, both in a normal field of vision and in a
mirror, and it is natural to relate voluntary control to an observed, observable movement. In contrast, the lower
back is behind you, and it would require a truly innovative mind to think of an excuse to look at the action of the
lower back in a mirror from profile while picking up stuff in the garage.
Fixing low back problems requires an awareness of what the lumbar muscles do, what it feels like when
they are doing these things, and what must be done to do them every time. Repeat the action of lifting your chest
and sticking your butt out several times to practice the voluntary contraction of these muscles. Just to be sure, get
on your belly on the platform and do the drill described in the “Back” section of the Squat chapter a few times, too.
Setting the back is essentially the opposite of a sit-up, which is an active flexion of the spine. Active extension of the
spine activates the muscles on the other side of the torso, and thinking about it this way can help.
Once you know what an extended low back feels like, you can get yourself into a good position at the bar in
steps. Take your correct starting stance, set your back, and lower yourself into position a little at a time by shoving
your butt back, your knees out a little, and your shoulders forward, going down until you feel your lower back
break out of extension. Then come back up as high as necessary to set it in extension again, and then try to get a
little lower than the last time. In this incremental way, you can eventually get into a reasonably good starting
position at the bar.
Back injuries are fairly common in the weight room, and unfortunately this is a part of training with heavy
weights. Both squats and deadlifts, as well as cleans and all other pulling exercises, can produce these painful,
inconvenient, and time-consuming problems. But knowing what actually causes them can lend a whole new
perspective on how necessary it is to prevent position errors that result in these injuries.
If you go to the doctor when you have a back injury, nine times out of ten she will tell you that “You just tore
a back muscle. Take these drugs and quit lifting so much weight.” This diagnosis and recommendation reflect a
lack of personal experience with these types of injuries and a lack of understanding regarding how and when
muscles actually get torn and how they heal.
Torn muscle bellies bleed. They are vascular tissues, and a tear of any significance disrupts the connectivetissue
components of the muscle belly to the extent that the contractile and vascular components burst; blood then
begins to accumulate in the area of the tear, producing a hematoma. This looks like a large bruise and goes
through the same processes that bruises do as they reabsorb and heal. Bad tears will leave a visible gap in the
muscle belly. Minor tears hurt like hell, too, but they don’t bleed enough to make a noticeable bruise. Little ones
heal quickly, while a major tear can take several weeks.
The majority of muscle tears occur in the thighs and legs, with bench pressing accounting for quite a few
torn pecs. These muscles are attached to long bones that either move heavy weights over a long range of motion
or accelerate the bones themselves very quickly over a long range of motion. In tears that occur during the bench
press or the squat, the weight itself provides more resistance than the muscle can temporarily overcome and the
rupture strength of the contractile tissue is exceeded. These tears can occur at any velocity of movement, even
after sufficient warm-up. More commonly, running injuries occur in which the contractile strength of either the
agonist or the antagonist muscle exceeds the rupture strength of the opposing component. Hamstrings, quads,
and calves are torn with unfortunate frequency, and this becomes more common as athletes age and lose both
muscle and connective tissue elasticity.
The common feature of muscles that are the most subject to belly rupture is the job they do: they accelerate
long bones around an angle. To do this, they produce long ranges of motion and relatively high angular
velocities. Contrast this to the job of the spinal muscles: they produce and hold an isometric contraction. They are
postural muscles, and their primary function is to hold a column of small bones in a constant position relative to
each other. Their morphology reflects this task: the spinal muscles are long muscles, true, but they all have
multiple origin and insertion points on a closely spaced, segmented, bony structure that is designed to be held in
place while the appendicular structures – the arms and legs – propel it through space. The vertebral column
depends on stability for its structural integrity, and though it features a relatively limited amount of flexure, it must
be held rigid as it bears a load. Lifting weights requires this rigidity, and the postural muscles of the trunk provide
it.
Back injuries often occur during lifting, and most usually occur when someone is lifting incorrectly. But even
when this does occur, the circumstances are markedly different from those in which a hamstring tears. A leg
muscle tears during a long angular contraction that involves a significant change in the muscle belly’s length over
a long ROM, whereas a back injury occurs over a small intervertebral ROM that may involve little or no movement
within the erector belly. Even if the entire lumbar musculature completely relaxes, not much movement will have
occurred, certainly not when compared to a sprint stride. This makes it highly unlikely that you will actually rupture
a back muscle belly while picking up a sack of groceries, yet these low-force, low-velocity types of activities are
precisely where most back injuries happen. In the absence of blunt trauma, true back muscle ruptures are quite
rare.
Most back injuries are, unfortunately, spinal in nature. Think of them as joint injuries, like a knee injury. The
intervertebral discs and facet joints are quite susceptible to loaded abnormal intervertebral movement, the kind of
movement that back muscle contraction is supposed to prevent. Strong back muscles developed through correct
lifting technique are perhaps the best preventative for back injuries, since the habits you form while lifting
correctly contribute to spinal safety just as much as the strength it produces does. Knowing this, pay extra attention
to form while learning to pull off the floor; it will come in handy. That’s a promise.
